- Hello there, I go by mischiefchrist and I like working magic or exorcism on the GNU Linux operating system ...
- I like building gnu/linux based from the ground up, starting with a single package, similar to LFS linux from scratch.
- I want to go to school to learn the c, c++, and java programming languages to become a game developer.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on linux development, and LFS linux from scratch based projects.
